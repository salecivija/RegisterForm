To install and start a React app, first, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your project. Run the following commands:

1. Download/Clone this project

2. Change your directory to created project:
   ```
   cd RegisterForm
   ```

3. To start the development server and open the app in your browser:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Regarding the open license, you can add a license file to your project. One common open license is the MIT License. To add it, create a file called `LICENSE` in the root directory of your React app, and paste the following content:

```
